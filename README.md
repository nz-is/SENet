# Squeeze and Excitation Networks in TF.keras
Reimplementation of [Squeeze and Excitation Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01507.pdf) in Keras 2.0.3+ 

Note: this was meant to be a practice and not some serious stuff

## Models
Current supported models:

- SE-ResNetV2. Custom ResNets can be built using the `SEResNet` model builder, whereas prebuilt Resnet models such as `SEResNet50`, `SEResNet101` and `SEResNet154` can also be built directly.
